                <p>I enjoy solving challenging problems and team based collaboration. I worked on the 'Make a Quiz' functionality for Quiz Fellows. Try it out for yourself!</p>
                <p>While I’m not in school, I enjoy  hanging out with my cat Mooshy, singing karaoke, and eating pickled okra.</p>

                <h3>Rob</h3>
                <p>I'm trying to learn as much as possible about as many different programming languages as I can. I have dabbled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python2.7/3.6, XML, Bash Scripting, and TI-Basic. I love solving math-based problems with code, and get lost for days at a time on ProjectEuler.</p>
                <p>Working on this project was a great experience for me, as it allowed me to collaborate deeply with my partners. My main contribution to the project was in programming the functionality of the quiz, but I also collaborated with Catherine on the quiz template.</p>
                <p>Since coming to Code Fellows I have learned many things and am becoming a more well-rounded programmer as a result. I am eager to continue on my quest for knowledge, and to ultimately use that knowledge in the workplace.</p>

                <p>I love pizza and Dr. Pepper.</p>
                <p>Specifically, on this page I worked on the login requirements and the flow of the conditionals as well as the logout logic and the local storage associated with the current user and passwords.</p>
                <p>So far the course has been more than helpful I can’t even begin to explain how much I have already learned here and I can’t wait to learn so much more.</p>
